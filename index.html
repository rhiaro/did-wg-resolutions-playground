<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-02-09-did#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2021-02-09</a>: To exit the DID Core Candidate Recommendation phase, the DID WG will require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at least two interoperable implementations per feature, where each feature is defined as one or more normative statement in the specification, and 2) for normative statements that are only human-testable, at least two demonstrations of implementation per feature, where each feature is defined as one or more normative statement in the specification.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-02-02-did#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2021-02-02</a>: The DagCBOR representation will be moved into its own specification and registered in the DID Spec Registries.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-01-05-did#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2021-01-05</a>: The DID Working Group will maintain the DID Spec Registries until the end of its charter. The DID Working Group plans to request the management of W3C to submit a charter for a maintenance DID Working Group to the W3C Advisory Committee as a successor to this Working Group. Per the planned charter of that Working Group, that group would officially manage the registry, and would do that in cooperation with the W3C Credentials Community Group..</li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-02-16-did-topic#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2021-02-16</a>: The ADM is only used to represent a DID document or parts of a DID document (e.g. a verification method).

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-12-17-did-topic#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2020-12-17</a>: The DID Working Group will maintain the DID Spec Registries until the end of its charter. The DID Working Group plans to request the management of W3C to submit a charter for a maintenance DID Working Group to the W3C Advisory Committee as a successor to this Working Group. Per the planned charter of that Working Group, that group would officially manage the registry, and would do that in cooperation with the W3C Credentials Community Group.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-12-17-did-topic#resolution2">Resolution #2 on 2020-12-17</a>: The DID Spec Registries maintenance process will be documented in the DID Spec Registries document..</li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-12-17-did-topic#resolution4">Resolution #4 on 2020-12-17</a>: W3C Staff need not be consulted on changes to the DID Spec Registries, but do have the final say on registry contents. This is to ensure that W3C can adeqately respond to time sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or other pressing concerns without putting an undue operational burden on them..</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-19-did-topic#resolution1">Resolution #1 on 2020-11-19</a>: sameAs/equivalentDIDs can only contain entries from the same did method as the the did document id.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-09-29-did-topic#resolution3">Resolution #3 on 2020-09-29</a>: The Working Group supports a general "preserve by default" design goal for the abstract data model. This means that a general rule for the abstract data model is to preserve properties that are not registered or documented anywhere, such as "foo": "bar", as long as the property name and property value datatype can be cleanly and losslessly consumed from a representation into the abstract data model and produced from the abstract data model to a representation. The WG may specify exceptions to this general design goal.</li>
